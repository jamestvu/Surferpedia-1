                <p>Surfing has been ingrained in Malia's blood since
                    she was born. As a baby, her parents would take
                    turns watching her on the sand while the other would
                    catch waves on the beaches of Kauai. As soon as she
                    turned two, Malia started surfing with them. Born
                    and raised in the small lush town of Wailua, Kauai.
                    Malia has been highly influenced by her culture. Her
                    father is born and raised on Kauai and part
                    Hawaiian, her mother is from Southern California,
                    making Malia "hapa haole", she said laughing.</p>

                <p>At the age of 8, she began surfing in contests
                    and fell in love with the surfing industry. "I never
                    planned on being a professional surfer, it kind of
                    chose me", says Malia. "I've been competing since I
                    was 8 years old and to now be one of the 17 Women
                    going for the World Title, seems pretty surreal
                    still."</p>
