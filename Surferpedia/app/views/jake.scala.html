				<p>Jake Marshall November 12, 1998 // Encinitas, California</p>
				<p>What sets Jake apart from the current crop of young talent is
					his drive to excel in his surfing, and whatever else he takes aim
					at. He's fiercely competitive, winning the Under-12 division at the
					Surfing America Championships at Trestles last summer as the
					youngest member of the USA team. But his focus isn't limited to
					competitive surfing. Jake is a straight-A student, and takes better
					care of himself than most seasoned pros with a strict vegetarian
					diet and a daily yoga regimen. With such a solid base already
					established, he should have no trouble moving up through the ranks
					in the coming years.</p>
