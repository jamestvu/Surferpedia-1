         <h2>Kalani David</h2>
           <p>It's unlikely old age will be kind to Kalani David. The 14-year-old Costa-Rica-born-Hawaiian-pro-skater-slash-pro-surfer is looking very uncomfortable seated across from me at a roadside eatery in Bali. The World Junior Championships are on and as of yesterday, he is now the highest ranked surfer in the world for his age (having lost out in Round 4 to one of the event favorite's, Conner Coffin). His biggest battle at the moment, however, is trying to reach the fried chicken on his plate.</p>
