Overview
--------

A [Play application](http://www.playframework.com/) that provides an encyclopedia of surfers.

This application is no longer static. Now you can create surfers, edit/manage existing surfers or even delete 
the surfers from the database. The surfer pages are created dynamically, based on user input.

There are three surfers initially in the database, used to help develop the application. One of each type of surfer
are created (one male, one female, one grom).



Installation
------------

Download the zip file, unzip, cd into the directory, invoke the Play console and execute run command to see the application at http://localhost:9000.

Usage
-----

Use the navbar to find interior pages with bio information on surfers.

Use the "New" link to add a new surfer to Surferpedia.

On the individual surfer pages, use the edit link to edit the surfer's information or the delete link to remove the surfer from the database.
